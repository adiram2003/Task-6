| Password               | Complexity | Tool Rating  | Time to Crack     | Feedback                        | 
|------------------------|------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| `adithya123`           | Good        | Weak         | >1 hour         | Add symbols and uppercase       |  
| `Adithya@123`          | Strong     | Medium       | Few hours       | Consider increasing length      |

## üîç Key Concepts

- **Brute Force Attack**: Repeated guessing of all possible combinations.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses common words from a wordlist to crack passwords.
- **Password Length**: Longer passwords = exponentially more secure.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds extra security beyond just a password.
- **Password Managers**: Tools like Bitwarden or LastPass to store and manage complex passwords.
- **Passphrases**: Long but memorable phrases (e.g., `Blue$Sky_Walks@Night123`) that are strong and user-friendly.

## üìò Best Practices Learned

- Always use 12+ character passwords.
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
- Avoid personal info or dictionary words.
- Use MFA wherever possible.
- Prefer strong, memorable passphrases over short, complex passwords.
